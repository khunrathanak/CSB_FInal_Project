This why I hate this anime
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=662"">11:02</a>  i watch this part without the censored and it traumatizes me 😧"
"for people who haven&#39;t watched, just know that the guy in the closet was the blonde girls dad<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I love watching people getting confused about this anime"
&quot;Is this cooking or Onlyfans?&quot; The answer in this case is Yes
As a muslim i qualified this anime in haram category

Food wars 💀
Bro I watched every single episode and season of food wars it like she just won’t admit his shit is good like dame 😂it an good anime you can watch on crunchy roll
it made my 3rd leg stand up
I know it kind of late but has Uncle Roger ever consider watching “Yakitate!! Japan.” This anime is considered the grand-daddy of anime food reaction. With gag elements that employ so many pop culture icons.
Is there a part 2?
What da HAIL is this cooking anime or   S@x video haiyaaa
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=505"">8:25</a> was too creepy"
"Bro watching p<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23rn"">#rn</a> in this point <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=708"">11:48</a>"
"Why are so many anime so <b>*strangely*</b> sexual?<br><br>There&#39;s far too much sexualization of minors, far too many creepshots, and far too much usage and normalization of sexual assault &amp; sexual harassment becoming mainstream in anime. It&#39;s beginning to make me uncomfortable with many new shows<br><br>It&#39;s scary how normal and almost expected it is"
This is why I don&#39;t watch anime
Huh. Didn&#39;t know Food wars was an anime for children.
please review The Magic Chef of Ice and Fire
"Nah, Soma put some aphrodisiac in that rice."
My third leg grow taller please stop this!1

When he said don&#39;t watch it. I&#39;ve watched all the seasons😂
It&#39;s not for kids
i can tell its his first time watching anime
More like horny war
Are you chinese?
"I have never watched food wars , And I never will"
I laughed 127 times on the floor^^
Uncle roger lore:He is 53 years old
when one asian guy uses a clip of other asian guy 😂😂
Aspic lmao
"She&#39;s dressed like a schoolgirl because she&#39;s a student at that culinary school. Also, that&#39;s not a cupboard, that&#39;s another room, and that&#39;s not a &quot;creepy old man&quot;, that&#39;s her grandfather, as well as the headmaster of the academy. This is the greatest cooking show known to mankind, which delves into everything cooking-related from gastronomy to psychology, and showcases cuisine from multiple different countries, including Japan, Italy, India, China, France, Brazil, and more, all recreated perfectly. You should at least know the basic plot. Also, give the dude a break. He&#39;s a teenager whose only formal training is learning from his father in their family&#39;s diner. The dishes get way more complex and impressive as the series goes on and he gets actual training from professional chefs. This dude needs to watch more anime. No one should be this dismissive of something after only watching a fraction of one episode."
My question is what would happen if she ate a krabby patt y?
"Cousins, please watch this anime at your own risk :3"
Bro stole one of his friends memes I feel sad for Steven he
anime is not for children<br>in anime playing tennis capable destroy half of the world (for example)
That creepy guy be the girl’s Grandfather🤣
Food wars for kid 😅
This anime is not for you unkle.
"This is good uncle Roger more anime. With cooking in it. At least the anime is censored. Also, none virgins still watch anime. 😂😂😂"
I fell of my chair when you said your favourite pic is aspic
Legendary words by uncle Roger&quot;trans rice is rice 😂😂😂😂&quot;
It&#39;s funnier when you narrate it lol
The creepy guy is the girl&#39;s grandpa and principal of the skl 🤣
"Uncle Roger , this anime has ecchi genre 😅😂 So don&#39;t watching anymore even the story all Abt cooking 😂😂 I&#39;ve finished watch these anime from s1 to s5 😂 But if u felt uncomfortable stop watching...."
"don&#39;t get it wrong just because it is an anime uncle, the guy who wrote this anime didn&#39;t use to do content suitable for children, as you might know by now"
Ça aucun sens cet animé 😂. Elle a un orgasme en mangeant. N&#39;importe quoi 😂
Show uncle roger sausage party
"spoiler his father runs a family diner. His father is the only chef God Tongue has ever respected but Yuki and the restaurant have his mother&#39;s name so all series she has no idea and is surprised by his skill that comes from seemingly nowhere, but is actually learned directly from the only chef she&#39;s ever liked the food of. Also old hiding guy is her grandfather and the principal of this culinary academy"
bro i died so hard in this episode
Uncle rogerDo not want anybody ruining Fried rice
uncle roger is so funny

❤❤
honestly tho just watch s1 &amp; 2 and stop there. everything after is garbage
😂😂😂😂😂😂😅
The trans rice comen sent me😂😂😂
"Uncle Roger should watch the whole anime, its really good and I learned a lot about cooking in it tbh"
I&#39;ve never seen so many round Japanese before!
I couldn&#39;t stop laughing on virgin niece and nephew 🤣🤣
I just kept sayong it gets worse😂😂
"I just love how everyones reaction is the same when they watch this anime for the first time, nice cooking, too much perversion. Just imagine his reaction if he watched whole anime."
food wars is so not halal
"After <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=505"">8:25</a> I couldnt stop laughing"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=514"">8:34</a> did she came just bc of rice and eggs haiyaa got me rolling on the ground"
I was waiting for the tasting part so exited to see how would he react
uncle roger should watch this anime full he will have so much to say specially in the nakiri effect on the dresses. and that is the grandpa of he girls
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=521"">8:41</a> yea thank me later"
I can&#39;t stop laughing if uncle roger complain
Minor mistakes uncle roger made<br>1.the angels he called are basically devils<br>2.the eye stuff is used to have cool animationcusually used in standoffs<br>3.the part of the heavenly thing is dirtier than the air on earth<br>4.the not enough flavor thing has uncensored part in it(dirty kids shut up its not it its the baby’s mouth being too annoying u gotta censore it to watch thru)<br>5.the spring onion cutting part was actually him cutting those onions repeatedly banging the table<br>6.the broth is dirtier than uncle nick’s jokes
l<br>\
I watched this anime and i had the same reaction  😂😂😂😂
"Uncle roger just so you know that girls about 17 so watch your words my friend <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=38"">0:38</a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=672"">11:12</a> Uncle Roger: Anime is supposed to be for children!<br>Anime Community: *Laughing.<br>Your ignorance is such bliss, Uncle Roger! 🤣👏"
This is why I can&#39;t watch anime. It&#39;s like someone took a normal show and made EVERYTHING sexual and over-the-top
"Whatever you do,you cannot trust anime"
This is one of the funniest things I&#39;ve seen in a while.
The anime isn&#39;t for children. It&#39;s R-rated.
😂😂😂 He Bill Cosby&#39;d this Lady!!!😂😂😂😂😂
LSD😂 damn never thought that
STOP FOOD WARS IS MY FAVORITE<br><br>(Better late than never)
It&#39;s not food wars it&#39;s orgasm wars but still the anime is on peak
He was a son of a mentor of her. But she didn&#39;t know about that fact yet<br><br>Edit: This &quot;creepy guy&quot; is her grandfather
"&quot;Uncle&quot;Its justan anime dont take it personally, watch and have fun dont complain it 😅"
Too late uncle Roger. I watched all seasons of this show YEARS ago
He got the super msg
if you are wondering why this show is like that... its because the manga was made by Shun Saeki and he is a H@ntai artist........ yeah hahahaha
trans rice is rice ajakjAJAJJAJAAJHAHAHA XD
"Haiyaa , why come so much ? Why come ?"
anime these day not for a children quite a while
He just Bill Cosby this woman 😭😭☠️☠️☠️
I wanna see uncle Roger remake this dish 😁
I thought this was supposed to be a family-friendly channel...
"WHAaaaaaa <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=497"">8:17</a>"
He doesn’t know that the creator of this anime used to make hentai and I think they still do lmao😭
as good as a show as it is its sus as fuck in nearly every episode if it wasn&#39;t for the good story the anime would be classed as its disgusting counter part and we all know what im on about
You don&#39;t look or sound like 52!! 😮😮
I Loved this anime! It&#39;s so funny! Also it&#39;s for 14 and up😅
This show is NOT for children Uncle Roger 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=520"">8:40</a> lol"
&quot;Egg Spiked Rice&quot;😂
Most laughs i ever had watching a video🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=470"">7:50</a>"
There would be a higher level of hilarity if he knew the creepy dude was her grandfather who is the director of the entire cooking academy. He can sneak around anywhere he wants. And that he&#39;s also super jacked and shredded.
That&#39;s the greatest twist😂<br>Most of the Anime is Not for children😂
both onlyfans and anime
Uncle Roger how about using fork for whipping eggs I&#39;m laughing I said hayiaah at the same time
"Man, I can&#39;t believe that I literally binge watched this anime back then. Its so embarrassing to watch this again."
How did I miss this. Now he knows anime is not just for children but for cultured peole
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I recommend restaurant to another world doesn’t matter which episode you will have a overall good time and I also recommend campfire in another world I don’t remember which episode but someone else probably remember but it’s the one with the wagyu. These anime nothing like food wars a bit more similar to one piece beef curry episode
Uncle Roger she is a school girl
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=571"">9:31</a> I beg your finest pardon?"
So glad I wasn&#39;t drinking anything when he made the comment about her reaction to the rice and what would happen if she had Ramen 😂
“Trans rice is rice” goated
&quot;what if she had ramen<br>her pussy will explode&quot;<br>got me laugh and fall off a chair
WTF was in that broth ???
"NO way <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a>🤣😂"
"this became popular when I was a young adult, watching a clip of the show at 30, i can only say that its so cringe lol"

What is the anime
"When I first watched it I thought it was gonna be this bomb food anime like the shows on Netflix cause the food anime’s be looking so good, but it was js some freaky dramatic stuff.. as usual 😐"
bro i thoght i was gana see nothing wild
wtf why she do moning
lol😂😂😂
hiiiya
Even rice can be trans nowadays. 😂
"Oh yeah, this is like 3/10 as far as how dramatic this anime gets <br><br>Also, to answer Uncle Roger’s questions: she’s dressed like a schoolgirl because it’s at a cooking academy, so she actually is literally a schoolgirl; the older guy is the principal and her grandfather"
"No why he talks without the accent <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=172"">2:52</a>"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=670"">11:10</a> THANK YOU UNCLE"
"he needs to watch the full series and do a reaction video on each episodes summary, this was soooo funny to watch!"
"no this show is not for kids I think its tv 14 or up, it has wicked sexual innuendos and dirty jokes and visualism hahaha never watch this with family around its wild XD the worst part is the reactions to the food they orgasm  basically lol"
Dude the story is actually good pass all the anime stuff 😂
wait till their clothes fly off XD
“Egg spike rice” PAHAHAH !!!
"If anybody is wondering why this anime is so sexual, its because the author is famous for his hentai, so plenty of foodgazm impressions in this series..."
<b>Where the Feathers came from</b>
I luv his vidoes funny reactions
"Yakitate!! Japan is a much better cooking anime. It has jokes other than &quot;the food is so good it makes you horny!!&quot; and the main character is voiced by the absolute goat, Mayumi Tanaka"
"“Did you just Bill Cosby this woman?! HAIYAA!”<br>-Uncle Roger, 2023"
Sauce???
After la im pretty sure uncle going to japan
Fun fact: The person who animated food wars used to be a Hent@i artist.
That guy put some magic in the food
I hate you watch anime cooking I don’t see a induction stove I see a normal stove Even my grandma use it and whisk are use chopsticks instead.
I can&#39;t stop laughing
.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=295"">4:55</a> thats a onlyfan cooking video 😂"
I knew the video was gonna be good when it said in title food wars the reason there&#39;s so many dirty scenes in this anime cause it&#39;s a harem anime
“Family friendly”

Uncle Roger: I dont think anime is only for children but for all ages.

I feel that uncle roger react at the final clip of the video it means that you reviewed it and shared us a &quot;Feeling&quot; of an animation❤
I tried watching that show once.. I only made it halfway through the first episode and was traumatized. It&#39;s so unnecessary and awkward. <br><br>But I also remember being 15... Thank God that stage is gone.
food wars is so dramatic for no reason 😂
I love your content uncle and your personality 😂❤

The manga is quite a bit more real and not so crazy.
"You think these reactions were something, you should see Toriko."
&quot;Her pussy gonna explode&quot;<br>-uncle roger
"By the way, I&#39;m on the last season. I&#39;m kinda guilty."
This anime is also rated ecchi. That explains the inappropiate scenes.
I knew this was gonna be a journey as soon as I saw that it was foodwars
"I wasn&#39;t pleased with the size of the items Bokksu provided. Even though there are variety of snacks, I didn&#39;t find it worth the cost for the small samples of treats. I canceled my subscription last month and received a confirmation email."
Simple rule anime is not for childern
react to Oshinobo instead !!! great food anime. no nonsense
I love Uncle Roger so much! 😃<br><br>They could only get away with this kind of reactions in Anime 😆<br>You start gasping and acting like that in Master Chef and you&#39;d get banned! 🤣
This anime 70% normal 39%hent--
"Hope uncle roger can react to flavours of youth san xian noodles animation, its masterfully done"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=608"">10:08</a> the real Haiyah 😂 he really is disappointed with the orgasm 🤣🤣"
"I hope Uncle Roger reacts to Cooking Master Boy Anime. It’s older than me, but it’s great."
Bhokat cha god tongue  ahe tu ya jvd tuya jvd pudi tongue ahe😂😂😂😂😂
Wow
I wanted to try the throwing knife hack now I got 6 finger left I regret it on that day
"&quot;is this a cooking show or Only Fans&quot; if only you knew, Uncle Roger"
"Enjoy the other 4 or 5 seasons Uncle Roger, the rush of feelings as they eat food is a recurring theme throughout."
Lmaoooo
lol I love food wars
reminds me when zoro tried to test his luck against the curse of the sandai kitetsu katana.
Only fan food anime 😂
and this wasn&#39;t even one of the weird reactions in the show lmao
Anime isn&#39;t meant for children anymore
Tbe fact that I watched three seasons of it and thought people act like that when they eat delicious food even in reality 💀
Food Wars = food hentai
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=550"">9:10</a> a** pic is mine too"

Uncle Roger learned that day that anime is never for children unless its ghibli studio 🤣
😂 I wonder how he would react to fried peanut butter and squid tentacles? Which is in this anime btw don’t kill the messenger 😅
The anime is one of the best. You don&#39;t have to go to hib anymore.
"The show really is sexual as hell. But it calmes down a bit after a few episodes. It still is sexual, but more funny later on. Really enjoyed the series. 😂😂"
Uncle Roger what is orgasm
9 months passed and still brought me to tears for laughing too much! We need the whole season!
HAHAHAHAHAHA 🤣😂 THE 3X HAHAHAHAHAHA

Watching you react to this was one of the best things ive ever seen in my life.
Egg spiked rice LMAOOO 😂
"&quot;it&#39;s for children&quot; no, no it&#39;s not."
The creator of this anime is not thinking twice
This is the weirdest anime i have ever seen as a beginner foodie and weeb
Why the food cause well I shall not say but<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>👩‍🦳➡️⚪️🤰
Somebody watching an episode of food Wars for the first time always makes me laugh my ass off

Trans Rice + Ass Pic 😅
Im beating egg with fork... 🥲
Good job uncle roger for censoing everything
I can&#39;t breathe 😭
"Uncle roger, thank you for your help! That is the exact brown rice green tea i have been searching for!!!"
I know for a fact he&#39;s prolly seen this anime before though
Please don’t censor
Trans rice is rice 😂

Never apologize for humor
Ummm... anime is for adults too.
that is her gradfather<br>uncle roger
I&#39;m eating egg fried rice- and the &quot;ah&quot; thing from that anime make me laugh so hard 😭
It’s not even that bad in the anime lol<br>Censoring makes it so much worse
never laughed so hard on a review vid
What did I just look at? I won&#39;t understand anime. But I liked the boobs and the female orgasm sounds.
Even Rice can be trans today <br>😂
Uncle roger you review the real life version from binging with babish
If you do another part do the anime: campfire cooking in another world
"Anime could be so much better, if they got rid of all the weird pervy aspects and focused more on the characters stories, like there is no reason for this show to be so weird, just cook, I swear they just make anime as an excuse to make porn, and then cover it up with a bit of story"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=154"">2:34</a> excuse me? 😂"

Someone said the truth!
"THIS EGG SPIKED RICE😂😂😂😂😂😂 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=699"">11:39</a>"

Ass pic was so suny😂😂
Best Anime you should watch with your family.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=699"">11:39</a> Egg Spiked Rice? More like Egg Drugged Rice."

Trans Rice is RICE! I&#39;m screaming!!! HHHAHAHAH
The most sus anime i&#39;ve ever seen.
everything is so dramatic and over the top in anime
Trans rice is rice - Uncle Roger
"Uncle roger is so fking funny when watching anime, who brought this up to him in the first place 😂"
Just wait until he sees Isshiki.
Bro watching Uncle Roger react to food wars is something I didn’t know I needed 😂😂😂
too crazy
that the worst cook i seen haiyah.......
"&quot;it&#39;s supposed to be only cooking video&quot;<br><br>Sorry, Uncle Roger"
<b>&quot;Not enough depth in flavour&quot;</b> im dead 😭
&quot;Why is she orgasm? I&#39;m dead
The disbelief in his face whenever she orgasms LMAO
WhO tHiS cReEpY bAbY? 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
"You don&#39;t know how humor in amine works.  If you&#39;re not used to types of elements in anime you don&#39;t understand, then don&#39;t watch it.<br>Also, she didn&#39;t ***, anime characters react to the taste of food like it&#39;s from heaven.  Another thing, f***ing ignore the people who are saying that anime is for kids.  Attach On Titan is 16+, One Piece is PG-14, and Chainsawman is 18+.  I&#39;m sorry to say this, but you&#39;re so disrespectful to the whole anime fanbase."
"&quot;Trans rice is rice&quot; I can&#39;t breath for 60s straight, almost dead."
18+
I am 11😂😂
You are spying on school girls uncle roger Me too
пиздатое аниме)) все сезоны просто нереальный кайф
I like how he says he’s trying to run a “family friendly channel” meanwhile he makes dirty jokes and has the 🟧⬛️ sound
&quot;Did she just orgasm?&quot; i was so shocked like i didn&#39;t even put my airpods on
Uncle Roger : I am trying to run a family friendly channel.<br>OG Uncle Roger Fans:Sorry children💀
Food porn😂😂😂
Haha this fun. I need more anime reviews from Uncle Roger.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=569"">9:29</a><br>Uncle roger 52 NOW ? Bro you like barely 30 tops. I&#39;&#39;d even say you look 23<br><br>Bro is 52 looking like 23 , mean while am 23 and i look like 33 -_- bruh i need your genes xd"
It is that easy to please woman. Woman love food. Food is fastest way to woman&#39;s heart.
NOT FOOD WARS
I think Uncle roger should react to campfire cooking in another world like after a meal they dont start stripping and shit
Fun fact: Food Wars meant to add some scenes to make our 3rd leg grow  large and it easily got popular in rule34 and other sus webs out there
Love your show but if If you&#39;re gonna criticize anime at least watch it and know the characters. You sound poorly informed. I say this as a fan to help you with your next.
"now that I got to rewatch this anime thru uncle roger&#39;s reaction video, i just realized how over dramatic those scenes were.....it had me rofl"
Totally not been laughing for 10 mins bc of the moaning 💀💀💀
it is a school
It&#39;s all dramatic because it&#39;s sort of a parody of anime tropes. They treat everything with the seriousness of a life or death struggle even though it&#39;s just cooking contests. There&#39;s a story arc about an underground cooking mafia.
Creepy man in the cupboard would be HER grandfather.
I didn&#39;t know this anime shit could get so sexual about food😓
The fact that the autor was a hentai autor is amazing
Oh my God I have watched you three years ago. I can’t believe I’m watching you again.😭😭😭
bro what the actual fuck is this
What would happen if Uncle Roger watched the rest of Food Wars?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=503"">8:23</a> DID SHE JUST ORGASAM😂😂😂😂😂"
Did she really just nut to food ?  💀
"First few episodes are excessively sexualised. After that, it primarily focuses on character, world building and food. Overall it&#39;s a very good show."
Listen here uncle....this good anime watch it lol
I appreciate the trans rice is rice joke
No rules.
😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyWp1npa6Ko"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyWp1npa6Ko</a> please commet this food war"
If you want review good anime cooking battle maybe I have &quot;Cooking Master Boy (1997)&quot;😊
Anime name?
i still don&#39;t understand how people watched this anime
&quot;Did she just orgasm?&quot; 🤣🤣I died laughing 😭
"Eh, Uncle Roger wasn&#39;t that upset when he saw the jiggly breasts, the butt, and the crotch covering, was he"
mm....god tounge...same like  tengen uzui wife...
Uncle Roger being dirty in the first half or the review until the anime backfire with spicy things and Uncle suddenly became a critic 😅
Why anyone watches this shit is beyond me.
I can’t imagine busting by rice 😭😭
Too dramatic and sexy.<br>I don&#39;t like. My mother doesn&#39;t approve.
Random facts if u are an filipino/filipina <br>and u know this snack called moby the caramel flavor if u take a look at the back your gonna see write on a back says  &quot;No MSG🥲&quot;
I think if he new there were five seasons he would die and the whole exploding clothes thing
The guy hiding was the boy&#39;s dad
You need to try and recreate these
This is incredible❤

I recommend YOU WATCH Food Wars and then tell us your comment about al Chefs in that show.
"Uncle Roger that&#39;s Rated Anime, not for children 😂😂😂"
😂😂im dead
"Uncle Roger: &quot;She coming just from egg and rice!?&quot;<br>Me: Welcome to the world of anime, Uncle Roger 🤣<br><br>I was laughing so hard when I saw you react to this 😂<br><br>On another note, try watching &quot;Campfire Cooking in Another World, there are wholesome cooking anime scenes, maybe you&#39;ll enjoy it"
😂😂😂What is the name of this anime?
"Bro doesn’t need a Oscar, he needs a therapist"
Haiiiyaa Uncle Roger trying to run family friendly channel! <b>swears 3 seconds later</b>
I&#39;m here for the lesbian food critics
"Uncle Roger, please react to the whole anime."
I now need the series of uncle roger reacting to foodwars

What if a man ate it? Would he nut?
"Sorry uncle, But this nephew already watched this anime 6 times and honestly I love it so much 😅"
"Uncle Roger, can you review Yakitate Japan anime scene, please?"
I am now in trouble with my mom
I reccomended this to a chocalateer who wanted to get into anime after not watching the show myself.  I can see why she didnt want to go on another date with me 😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=150"">2:30</a> Ayo"

How is he older than my parents

We can all agree that cooking ingredients are better than anime waifus
I need Uncle Roger to become Anime Critic hahhaha😂
Bro.  Having watched this show. I was waiting for the taste test lol.  It&#39;s basically a show where they eat then have their clothes blown off because it&#39;s so delicious
"I love this anime. Uncle roger, do more anime food reviews. But beware. Anime will rub iff on you. Otaku disease"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=788"">13:08</a> pls don&#39;t tell me he got aroused or smth."
The aspic got me off guard💀

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=496"">8:16</a>  ayoooo"
&quot;Is this food anime or onlyfan&quot; well author used to draw hentai anime so it was expected.
&quot;So dirty!&quot;<br>Well considering the manga artist did hentai before getting a series in Weekly Shonen Jump its not too farfetch&#39;d.
All of the nephews and uncles third leg standing up
That is the most un original cumming but this is really dirty
Uncle Rodger broke the number one rule of watching Food Wars....watch that shit by yourself😂
“what happen if she eat ramen? her pussy gonna explode?” 😂😂😂😂😂
Bro I can’t believe uncle roger love a$$pic haiyaa
Anime = softporn
He meant fish ...his god tounge loooooves fish

"Typical! <br>You satisfy her 3 times, still calls you disgusting! 😂<br><br>Sorry children! 😅"
"I&#39;m glad Uncle Roger didn&#39;t hold his punches on this anime lmao <br><br>The way it was written always bothered me as well. Mundane (good, sure, but mundane) dishes being made in the most unnecessarily epic way possible,  making women cum and get naked like ???? Please, we all know this was not made for people who like food, this was made for weebs lmao"
I’ve never seen this anime but I thought it was about cooking 😂 but they don’t even the process wtf I’m glad I didn’t watch it
The yogurt helped in tenderizing the meat.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=25"">0:25</a> guessing Uncle Roger will throw in hamsap fit after the food critic tasted the food😂"
i will now watch this anime 👀 (not)
Food wars is just weird
her pusy going to explode 😂😂😂
Its so nostalgic to hear Erina and Soma again. Thanks Uncle Roger
Anime is not for Children. Anime is for 20+ Year Old Virgins
He really said trans rice 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
uncle roger made that scene an H* its just a fan service and is in between within fine line but with those heavy censorship its now an H** ahaha
I am sure Uncle was the same as baby😂
The anime really took the term “food p*rn” way too literally
YAYAYAYYAYAYA I CAN NOW COMMET
Food war = Food + hentai😂 people get exiceted abou food😂
"Uncle Roger: I want my channel to be family friendly<br>Meanwhile on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=510"">8:30</a>"
Spiked ICANT
This veejio so dirty but i like it<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>dont judge me-

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=285"">4:45</a> I use a fork"

"Uncle Roger only puts his leg down from chair when the cooking or food is gross (or incorrect.) Now, he puts his leg down from chair when the video he watches is gross."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=657"">10:57</a> 3rd leg stood up"
That creepy guy spying on them is the cooks dad
"He didn&#39;t put msg, he put lsd💀"

虽然我的英语不太好，但是勉强看懂也笑死我了
Where is @nickgviovanni
Wait till he sees episode 2 and onwards 😂
"Im somehow terrified of Souma meeting Senku. Its my greatest fear, like theyd cause a havoc😂"
The mangaka of Food Wars is normally a H3nt41 artist. Did you notice?<br><br>Also Souma is canonly asexual and literally only interested in making people happy through food (or the opposite if his dad&#39;s around)
When i first started watching Food Wars i kept thinking about jow i love Souma&#39;s voice. But then i got into seiyuu and now all i hear is TsuguTsugu. I can see him voice act the thing😂😂<br>(I still love his voice tho)
‘What gonna happen if she eat ramen? Her p*ssy gonna explode?’<br>-uncle roger
&#39;Or egg gay rice&#39; 💀

"You were going to review ANIME FOOD, instead you mostly criticized the anime 🤣🤣"
"I can&#39;t remember the name, but I saw this cute slice of life anime on Crunchyroll and Netflix a couple years back where the main character kept making new friends with his cooking until suddenly he was having whole supper parties<br>&quot;Trans rice is rice&quot; is gonna live in my head for a good while 😂"
“Trans rice is rice” 😂😂
Erina looks mad bangable
The anime is literally food porn.
This is great do more

"The most annoying thing to hear in this subject , &quot;Anime is for kids&quot;. 😮‍💨 <br>Uncle Roger, you too old. Haiiiyaaaa 😭"
"A divine tongue, a god tongue. Many of my exes would say the same about me, so what now"
One of the funniest things I&#39;ve watched in forever.
"Yeah…<br>For those that are unaware, ‘Food Wars!’ is basically ‘Food Porn’ the Anime &gt;.&gt;"
One like for the jamie Oliver joke 😂
Food + naked apron = best show
My brother got me a bokksu subscription two years ago. The white chocolate infused strawberry was AMAZING!!!

"Yes, right on point. The close-up to the eye is an anime thing 😂"
"She&#39;s spying because he is her grandpa, he wants to know if the boy will pass the test (kinda actually spying on the boy actually). The boy is son of an old friend of his"
She&#39;s dressed like a school girl because she is a school girl 😅 it just happens that because she has genetically the best tongue in the world (for food) she is also a food critic
It&#39;s not her mother&#39;s milk tho 😅
"&quot;This isnt egg fridd rice, its egg spiked rice&quot; <br><br>    -Uncle Roger 2023"
"&quot; did she just orgasm&quot; truer words have never been spoken. also <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=377"">6:17</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=380"">6:20</a> is too true🤣🤣"
Ah yes what happened if an kids see this 😂
"Yup, Uncle Roger this is anime,<br>Gotta get use to it, plus to do that,<br>You gotta watch more and more"
“Trans rice is rice”
In japan the sexual culture are in everithing uncle roger xD
"Ok boomer. <br><br>Extremely lazy video. Watch at least a couple of episode, if not a season. <br><br>You&#39;re making money from it, work a little."
This woman is eating rice one at a time
uncle roger is having a melt down in his mind🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=666"">11:06</a> my honest reaction 💀"

Yes
We need a review of all 5 seasons from Uncle Roger season 5 is meh but seasons 1 - 4 are pretty good
"Eu ri muito de seus vários comentários de comédia e criticei séries de anime.<br>Sei que algumas séries de anime não são para crianças, apenas adultos, cuidado para não assistir crianças. Só é possível maiores de 18 anos assistir anime. HAHA HA.😆😆<br>Gostei muito do seu vídeo. Mantenha seu trabalho é incrível!"
I was waiting for the orgasm review
Now we need him to review the peanut butter squid
Please review more food wars this is so funny
Egg spiked rice😂😂😂😂
Legend says that uncle roger finished the anime in 3 days
Well your first mistake is thinking this anime was for children lol XD
"Uncle Roger: &quot;This is cooking anime, not Only Fans!&quot;<br><br>Me: oh, just you wait. You aint seen nothing yet! She&#39;s just STARTED to taste it!"
I would love to see Uncle Roger review the whole food wars series
Uncle Roger didn&#39;t even leave anime than who is Cordon Ramsey 😂
Date tip: egg and rice
“What happens if she taste ramen is her pussy gonna explode?” Bro got me cracking up
Uncle roger is the transforming rice is a good idea or not?
cant wait for the era when anime gets over its obsession with gigantic titties
yes it is an anime thing
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=377"">6:17</a> got me dying of laughter"
This anime so family friendly 🗿
"I love this anime! It makes me laugh uncontrollably!!! Like, DUDE! It’s just food. I can’t get enough how over the top this show is 🤣"
I love how in the out-takes Nigel seems genuinely surprised by the things Uncle Roger says.
I legitimately couldn’t watch it cause it was just too fucking weird. Like I just wanna watch a cooking anime without seeing some anime bitch moan and shit. I just wanna watch my goddamn anime. I’m here to watch anime not fucking p*rn
bad
&quot; but i don&#39;t just use it on foo- &quot;<br><br>Me : Chokes on coffee<br>😵😖😫😢🥲
you kno you&#39;ve been approved when the food critic cant stop eating your dish
heh heh heh I&#39;m still gonna think these dirty thoughts uncle   <b>leering</b>
You are like Yan Can Cook on MSG!….  💯
did she just ORGASM?!?!?!
Isshe sa foot critec?
This man is a trip 😂
Is it cooking anime? 😏
"Oh Uncle Roger, it gets worse (😏) as you go along the series 🤭"
"Uncle Roger wishes Auntie Esther reacted like that to his cooking, haiyaaaa"
"Ya we get it you don&#39;t like anime, just don&#39;t do reviews of it and don&#39;t watch it that&#39;s it. Criticizing it, saying it&#39;s all disgusting, there are better anime out there and worse ones"
I love seeing the end bloopers xD
The fact that this anime transitioned to some food anime into a hentai anime is just crazy.
"Will watch this show for, um...science."
"So there&#39;s a German children&#39;s book called &quot;König Leckermaul&quot; (~King Foodie), where there&#39;s a king heavily invested into over-the-top-fancy dishes. So he came to a point where he ate everything that people could cook and now it&#39;s all flavorless to him. In the end, some apple and cheese bring him down to earth and let him enjoy food again - and this scene reminds me so hard of it!"
you can use a fork aswel
😂 I can&#39;t stop laughing 😆 &quot;is she cuming a third time&quot; 😭🤣😭
I can&#39;t believe I used to watch this
"I watch food war until season 2😅, and I found you😊 and I am interested in hearing your review for this! I&#39;m continuing to watch it soon😂😂😂, and your vlogs too!😊 Stay awesome! Critic vs critic 🤣🤣🤣"
i really do hope that roger is just joking about this video. cause he is at that 1% population of people who will die not knowing how good animes are. people who says anime is for kid are literally bullied when they were kids
Trans rice is rice shirt….money!!
Your commentary is exactly why I come to this channel 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=505"">8:25</a>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
I&#39;ve had vegetarians eat my meat Uncle. This anime is one of the reasons 😂
I haven&#39;t laughed this hard in à year
"Finally, egg on rice with sauce"
Rip uncle roger family friendly
More food wars! Lol
Insanime cooking.
Wth I was watching this with my mom 😅 RIP me
So basically what ive learned today is foodwars = kakegurui but instead of gambling its food
Egg Spike Rice. I died.
A whisk is too hard to clean.
&quot;Just Bill Cosby this woman&quot; 😂😂
At the first scene when the guy said at three months he said his very first word or whatever i thought he was gonna say f### you
THIS ANIME NEVER WAS ABOUT FOOD BRUG
this is why I never watched food wars. Its overdramatic 😭😭😭
The funny thing about this is that while Uncle Roger is hating on Food Wars I’m out here laughing my ass off waiting for what he’ll say next🤣 Uncle Roger should do more Food Wars anime reviews
Use your god tounge on lolipop too
The perfect reaction for this anime. You should react to the whole thing. Foodgasm taken to extremes 😂
I can&#39;t stop laughing at this sht lmao I didn&#39;t know I&#39;d cringe so much seeing one of my favorite anime getting &quot;reviewed&quot; by Uncle Roger.
uncle roger + anime?? what else could i ask for?? 😩😭🙏🏼❤️
Oops I watched every season twice
"Thnx Uncle Roger for the <a href=""http://video.now/"">video.Now</a> I am gonna never recommend anyone to watch this anime.😂"
This was the funniest review I&#39;ve ever seen.
The drug part men 😂
Uncle roger you shoud youje more anime 😂is funny ❤❤❤
Anime is satanic......very evil.
"I&#39;ve never laughed so hard, especially that one scene where she tastes it 😂"
"Erina is like 15 or something bruh, these Anime chicks are mad stacked lol"
What happens when she eats ramen? Her pussy explode? Best line ever😂
"This part makes me laugh all the time. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=371"">6:11</a>"
52 years old?!?!?!
uncle roger wasn&#39;t ready for that
"try watching the whole series, it&#39;s for adults not for children. lmao."
Welcome to softcore food porn Uncle Rodger
Alternative tittle: uncle roger watches a high school girl critic coems
gay wommen
"YOU&#39;RE 52!?<br><br>Damn, and I thought I looked young for my age.<br><br>Also makes your reactions ten times funnier."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=655"">10:55</a> is so funny  this anime is so dramatic 😭"
Yo you need to see the mapo tofu episode
With this people will know that anime is not for kids
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=659"">10:59</a> ok what the actual fu-"
I had the same reaction too when I first watch food wars. But after awhile you will get used to it 😂 Great anime ngl! It makes me hungry most of time 😅
Fun fact most animes nowadays are not made for kids 😂
No trans joke will ever top the one in this video (this joke approved by a trans person)
Correct term is called food gasm and only really really good food makes a person do that lol
Kangen bgt ama soma
I&#39;m so glad I never watched this anime. What an uncomfortable show.

Trans rice is rice😂😂😂 not mean to offend somebody😂😂
<b>“She’s the sexy anime version of uncle roger”</b><br>                                 -uncle roger
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=512"">8:32</a> killed me🤣"
Rogeru-ojisan you don&#39;t get it anime ...is really not for children -family but for children that&#39;s growth as adults and some families not family...  Anime is not your way but i love how to deal with it by your kind way and... For that about that yes... Dirty sorry child is life and spirit of Japanese and being with anything and for cooking for food likes we say human eating drinking sleeping and ....man and woman they call it naturally but for our side at their foreigners is such wired for people around world
uncle roger you make me laugh from these videos 😂
"Bro said &quot;I trying to run family friendly channel, I can&#39;t be showing this shi-"
Is that all I gotta do to get a girl to like me? Put eggs and jellified broth on rice damn what has the world come to 😂
I think the biggest clothing explosion was in the episode with the steak face off. The girl so sure of herself with the A5 Waigu beef.<br><br>I must have watched that one a hundred times. And I still don&#39;t think I have his recipe down yet - maybe the pickled plum paste HAS to come from his Grandma. Amazon just doesn&#39;t cut it?
"&quot;i never woman come from soup&quot; haiyaaaa uncle roger, you not souma-kun. souma-kun make women go like dat."
"i followed this recipe and it tastes amazing! it takes more time a ingredience than it looks like - i cook this every sylvester, always preparing the jello cubes one day before xD<br><br>edit: food wars is not for children xD not every anime is aimed for children :D"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=503"">8:23</a> Uncle Roger has perfect &quot;tourist&quot; reactions to this anime. Makes me want to rewatch it 😆"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=610"">10:10</a> that haiya was personal"

I was hoping the seasoning for the rice with seasoning was msg
&quot;trying to run a family friendly channel&quot;<br>Also him :<br>&quot;Sorry children&quot;<br><b>shows ass pic (Blurred)</b>
Love so much food Wars. But love also how uncle Roger keeps sames standards to judge an anime!
Hell no she just moaned😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=718"">11:58</a> the bombastic side eye from uncle roger 😂😂"
But in Philippines we use fork to mix the egg
R18+ lol
aspic lol
Yeeeeeah it&#39;s tropes like these that give anime a bad rep.
Roger is exactly how I felt about this show when I first tried watching it :cry: I never have and never will continue it lol its too much for just a cooking anime
The series gets better😂
You keep saying no whisks but we use forks in this house to beat eggs. I don’t know what you mean
idk why but i really want to see his reaction to Isshiki&#39;s cooking attire
Yes this +18 style anime being for kids 🤣
ngl it is a good show tho
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=530"">8:50</a> maybe cause u a quickshot lol"

Uncle please make this dish
welcome to the anime land Uncle Roger 😂
the best moment is when he says who this creepy baby💀
"&quot;anime is for children&quot; XDD it&#39;s really not, it&#39;s mainly aimed for Teenagers and adults. the only anime aimed for children are mainly the dubbed anime"
Uncle Roger that is miss God tounges Grand father.. the one in the closet. 😂😂
I love how our reactions were the same to when the characters eat the food. I was waiting for that moment from the beginning of the video just picturing what Uncle Roger would say when she ate it 🤣🤣🤣 I remember when I first watched this show lol
You should’ve seen the fool version
i love shokugeki no souma and I completely hated watching this. almost cried. not a show Id ever watch with someone lmoaoo
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=341"">5:41</a> no it’s your mom 💀"
Those smooth Uncle Roger segues into the ad reads
I can&#39;t even watch this anime it&#39;s so bad. Nothing but gross fan service and not even impressive food battles.
"Uncle Roger, the creators of this show actually wrote hentai. Which is the reason for all the extra sexual scenes."
You missed the part where the creepy man comes out of that room and eats the food
yo i didnt know this was ecchi 😂😂😂 wtf all that reaction when she ate a piece of rice omg
AYOOO
… Yao wth
"Uncle roger , <br>Anime is the most dramatic and has so many shots of fighting,scherts,even <br>THE BEDROOM<br><br>べdろおm<br>报恩当然区欧美"
the rice must have been really good😀
I actually watched every episode of this anime 😂😂
I remember this anime author is originally hentai anime drawer so the author already did less dirty stuff
The moment after the food enters the mouth reminds me of that one meme of the 1800s pianist with his piano on fire because i literally hear a choir everytime theres the moment after the food get put in mouth
Ikr this anime is overated cause of that uhhh scene....i love anime cooking but....this
"Uncle Roger, we Indians don&#39;t use chopsticks and are still Asian then how can we use chopstick for whisk."
Go and review Marion Grasby cooking
Uncle Roger can you try making the trans-rice for a vid?
Even uncle Roger watches Japanese dub with English subtitles
&quot;Uncle Roger trying to run family-friendly channel&quot;<br><br>him 2 minutes ago: did she just orgasm?<br><br>so much for being family-friendly
You mean the Less sexy version of uncle Roger
"LGBTQ moment <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il0VeFfKg7w&amp;t=765"">12:45</a>"
