Naruto basic ?????????
I’m trying to go to bed it’s currently 1am but now I’m hungry and laughing my ass off 😂
🍜🍥🥷🏻🥋
i like to have auntie hersa in bondage
im shit
Liking Naruto is like liking jamie Oliver
"I have many japanese style restaurants around, the all serve ramen, none of them actually make ramen."
"Go get a smoker?? I’m regularly getting in trouble for smoking cigarettes on the balcony, let alone meats…. seriously these f’in people and their money……. Just completely absent from reality."
&quot;thats a bit basic&quot; 🤣
There are smaller smokers than that. But still does the job the same.
Normally you marinade prior to cooking
i was thinking of what ingredient he was missing and i remembered aroma oil thanks uncle roger i am going become the best chef in the world
Uncle Roger regrets things from now on bc of guga in the comment section💀🤧
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=273"">4:33</a> damn that was fireeeeeee"
We gonna ignore tha fact it’s supposed to be extra spicy miso broth and extra firm noodles
can&#39;t believe Uncle Roger used such a harsh insult on both Naruto and Coldplay by comparing them in anyway to Jamie Oliver
this is crazy but i love anime so i approve
Naruto IS NOT BASIC
Ngl I would eat this with some chili oil and as long it has aroma oil
Sakura and Jamie Oliver have one thing is they are both useless
90% of the vid is complaining. Have you even tried Guga&#39;s version?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=172"">2:52</a> 😂"
Chicken FEET IS THE BESTTTTTTT
Lol! Serious! This is awsome! 😂

You find button you press. NUKE RUN😂😂

Naruto hates menma

I&#39;m so disappointed in chefs cooking 😔😔😔😔😔😔
So this guy is just as bad at making food as Babish is
oppisite of micheal jackson kill me 😂
Me when Uncle Roger say he can barely afford stove: lol
Please uncle roger may you respect others when they aren’t allowed to eat pork?
The paper towel trick is ingenious. Thanks Uncle Roger. And you can use it on just about anything you need to marinate. Did it with homemade beef jerky.
Nice
BRO I SWEAR FOOD WARS AND ONE PIECE OR BETTER CHEFS THAN THIS GUY
One important element in ramen look im the reply
"you are judging him , meanwhile your english is worst"
Aroma oil is not a must!! Many super famous Ramen places in Japan keep it super simple and Im convinced they dont use those oils
Ramen looks good. only downside is its from midruto
I work at msg factory
Im not even Asian and I cant go a week without chicken or duck feet
cooking is different in different place there own recipy
"&quot;Stop thirsting over woman, thirst over MSG.&quot; Now that&#39;s one hell of a mantra."
"Uncle Roger: F**k induction stove, use real fire<br>also Uncle Roger: Guga use too much fire"

Guga Smoker ist bigger than my Apartment
Uncle Roger. You should review JunsKitchen ramen
Hey bro u might die after saying naruto basic
Uncle Roger. You need to go to US teach those guys how to make proper Ramen.
"Jesus Christ, antie Helen called me wrong name one and that&#39;s how i know she&#39;s cheating"
Uncle Rogger: This Ramen is more useLess than Sakura hiyah.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=263"">4:23</a> “smoker” <br>Me:*calls the cops* hello police there’s a person doing drugs here"
ay naruto is not basic
"Actually as an indian i had urge to eat ramen after looking at in anime all time . But once i tasted it , ewww thats trash , if you&#39;re indian ( bhai thoda sa namak nhi , kacche unde , kaccha meat sab kaccha kaccha, taste nhi kuch nhi usse acch apne thele ke noodles lagte hai ye ramen sirf dikhne me acche hote hai , bhai meetha and fika fika ) honest review."
The  best
The egg needed few more minutes to be done and little thicker noodles too
Ramen ❤
Pause
🇲🇲
Uncle Roger don&#39;t say bad about Naruto
Rogers doesn&#39;t represent all asian dishes.
Pork is haram ❌
or instead of penetrate use seep in
"Why you say that bringing woman in bed first and then make dinner is bad? it&#39;s even better, try it"

What up about us older guys that liked naruto as the first long series anime after dbz?
Uncle Roger can you make it the proper way from Japan please.. so i can follow the steps one by one
Uncle Roger:&quot;Who marinate before cooking?!&quot;<br>Me:LITERALLY EVERY COOKBOOK IN WORLD SAYS ABOUT MARINATING MEAT BEFORE COOKING IT.
My grandma&#39;s recipe has marinated meat before cooking
Awesome video man!
Uncle Roger: who marinates before cooking?<br>Everyone else: who TF marinates after cooking?
"Why so weak UK? can&#39;t you stand The Walking Dead? You did first with 30 days later, Why not now? Haiyaaaaa"
ILOVEMSG
i love naruto but his favorite food is haram for us muslims so its kinda sad
i am asian but don&#39;t like chicken feet.but my mom does

"Go ask a kid if he wants to get beaten, NO KIDS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE BEATEN!! According to Section 17 (1) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 expressly bans subjecting a child to mental harassment or physical punishment."
When uncle says sorry children i reply it&#39;s okay
One no-english complains about another no-english pronounciation...
madharchod khudko to kuch aata nhi<br>dusro ki buraiya nikal rha hai

uncle rodger i like your videos but from now i hate you bcoz you dont like naruto <br>Naruto is the GOAT of anime 🫤
Msg makes me thirsty for more msg
Food in anime allways looks way too delicious

Marinating before cooking is extremely common. Calm yourself uncle roger. It might not be asian but its not wrong.
Uncle roger is rich he has a house
We&#39;re Mexican and love chicken feet 😋😋
Am i the only one that doesnt find this guy funny at all? I felt kinda annoyed at the forced humor.
You can either beat your kids or be Californian to learn how to roll shit
My niece and nephew say they are thirsty <br>Uncle roger say dont be pussy 😂😂😂

it is not a uncle roger weejio if he doesn`t say `haiyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!`
&quot;no msg added&quot; on the msg...
Who doesn’t eat chicken feet it’s DELICLOUS!!!
me marinade before cooking
"While visiting London, we tried Naruto ramen from “Uzumaki” around the Natural Museum. Saying it was tasty is an understatement."
Why would someone NOT marinate BEFORE cooking???
@mrnigelng AKA uncle Roger So  Chicken feet in Japanese and Chinese  Tonkotsu Miso ramen traditional or just a nice touch to add to the Broth ?
I know cause I’m black
He is racist
Love watching your videos uncle Roger 😂
Thanks for admitting your mistake it’s very appreciated. Please stop talking about Only fans it’s so annoying.
"Nothing like tightly tied meat waiting for some more hand work, am I right? Yeah, I just love cooking."
That like bringing woman to bedroom and then buy them dinner...🤣🤣
&quot;Who marinate before cooking?&quot; ummm... filipino adobo and barbecue?
"I mean, my father used a stainless steel hanger instead of a paper roll since hindustan times is too thin."
The Ramen that only Kakashi would pay.
Why did you say my name Michael
Uncle aa habis semua u goreng lei hahhaha
Mf you better not ever disrespect Naruto it’s not basic your cracker outfit is basic don’t YOU EVER DISRESPECT NARUTO
See the difference? : Narutomaki | Naruto<br> YOU SEE? IT&#39;S HIS NAME THAT&#39;S WHY HE LOVES IT
"We americans from the south east like some strange meats, chicken feet is just as good as alligator feet, or turtle feet to us."
Chashu: who&#39;s char siu?😂😂😂
true aroma oil is a must.😅
😂😂🎉
I am very disappointed in uncle Roger by Calling Naruto Basic
How many times can I like this vid
I used to love Naruto when i was a kid. <br><br>I always wanted the ramen in it but i was poor and live in America so its always been out of my reach
Hey! Whats wrong with coldplay 😢

Did armys noticed one thing?
a marathon is race
"I have secret miso ramen recipe i have been working on for 16 years after struggling to find good vege ramen in the Uk. <br>The recipe is as follows:<br>- Do you not know the meaning of &quot;secret&quot;? :P<br><br>EDIT: Also, shots fired at 13/14 year old me whos favourite anime was naruto 😂 (but at least i never liked Jamie Oliver)"
"煮高湯應該使用豬大骨,湯才會濃厚!"
Guga isnt the strongest in cooking tbh
Char shu
"&quot;I wish chicken can start onlyfans&quot;, dosen&#39;t everyone, Uncle Roger? I mean Chicken feet pretty good."
Bro gusses like he is gordan Ramsey bro make a video making a Naruto ramen
And what is their reference to compare ? Cup Noodles ?
As a Filipino I eat a local barbecue chicken feet fried chicken feet and adobo chicken feet
"um i have never heard of marinating after you cook, its always before, never after"
"Uncle...... <br><br>Pork is not halal, pork is haram"
"Me: sees pork ribs after watching a certain Chinese drama on repeat for about three months....ooh, lotus root and pork rib soup?!"

Last air bender isn’t a anime
Uncle roger can you explain why some people get a headache from msg
MSG wont leave you. unless auntie helen come back for it HAIYAAAAA
"Growing up an American Japanese boy in California, I just missed the Naruto hype as highschool was starting in the early 00&#39;s right. Years and years go by, and I start to wonder why servers at &quot;japanese restaurants&quot; question or gave looks when I asked for extra &quot;chashu&quot; as that&#39;s just how I was told by my family it&#39;s called, right? Whatever, do the Gringo thing and just ask for pork. (Once even a server tried helping me say it which just lead to both of us back n forthing variations of &quot;ciaaarshu caash chasss char chas ueuu ieueu oo etc etc). Now, I&#39;ve finally finished watching Naruto and right away I started seeing &quot;Char-Siu&quot; in the CCs. I let myself think, &#39; o you did have it wrong this whole time&#39;. Not, but really, it&#39;s just that some CC company and the writers being cute, like Donut/Riceball cute. Annoying."
The Wesley snipes line got me😂😂😂😂
Am I only the 13 yr old who is acctualy uncle of a real person?
im going to tell everyone now that uncle roger says: thirst over msg not over woman
Uncle Roger- how did you let him get away with using a whisk?

Uncle Roger: is smokey barbeque pork halal? <br>Me: no you trynna destroy our religion 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=644"">10:44</a>  But before MSG we have: Fat, Salt, Sugar...  The Nestle tri-fecta."
Don&#39;t talk trash about someone cooking
"I would like to see Nigel make ramen, the right way, I too am annoyed when people put meat in broth when it doesn&#39;t always need it."
My hall family loves chicken feet and we eat it with a little bit of spice
I love chicken feet all Asian love chicken feet why you say chicken feet no look good Fuiyoh! 9What do you think of impression? Also I really do love chicken feet.)
"Clue about English idioms and figures of speech:   <br><br>When you want to signify that  some process is going to take a [ long ] period of consistent, strenuous effort instead of a short time of strenuous effort,   you say <br><br>It&#39;s a marathon not a race."
hint:   165 degrees F is   approximately.  74 degrees C.
"In my opinion,  the proper place for the smoker is outside in the back garden as the centerpiece of your fancy outdoor entertaining area near the barbeque grill and the hibachi"

Bc stop it!!! Every culture has every cultural way....u being asian doesn&#39;t  mean u judge asians across the world on ur own basis!!!
Proud to have never watched Naruto.
naruto is the best anime for me too^^ Dont try to change my mind pls😂
👍👍👍👍👍
who marinate before cooking .. ? bruh really uncle at this point i dont think he know how to cook what the hell
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=561"">9:21</a> It probably seemed fast but his eggs are kinda small."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=149"">2:29</a> Did he say Miriam? What if I don&#39;t know any Miriams? Can I substitute her with someone else?"
At least he can say Naruto’s name correctly unlike you uncle Roger
"Am here for the funny lines he drops , very funny"
Whyyyy did you make fun of Naruto
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=376"">6:16</a> when you lost 6 iq points from watching anime"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=355"">5:55</a> when you get iq from school 😮"
想笑撚死人😂
and he said who loves chicken feet? i got triggered 😂😂 <br>me who orders 5 trays of chicken feet at dimsum place:
I love both Naruto and Coldplay and uncle just destroyed both in one sentence 😿
hippies and child abusers the duality of learning how to roll
Don&#39;t you dare say that Naruto being favourite means the same as someone&#39;s favourite chef being Jamie Oliver. You demean Naruto !
Love your analogy 😂
Anytime you say something mild be in appropriate you say sorry children thank you thank you for that
Chicken feet adobo is literal heaven
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=725"">12:05</a> to skip to see what he forgot."
Uncle Roger please review any ramen videos from Ramen Kaonashi.
what if you just add instant ramen noodle instead?
Uncle roger know about last air bender fuiyo
Thanks ❤😊😊😊😊❤❤❤🎉
when guga smiles over food he look like happy buddha at entrance of chinese restaurant. It is a good smile.
actually it&#39;s called Donkatsu
yeah but expressvpn can see what you viewed
bro shut up stopcomaplining kid
OnlyFeet.... Chicken feet...
I am japanese to
Uncle roger review Biriyani
🤣🤣not Wesley Snipes fam
i know its a crime - but when im cooking this dish i eat udons with it
"As a Japanese who living in Fukuoka.never, ever add miso in ramen soup fk he ruined the tonkoutsu ramen."
I love how he said googar lol
I don&#39;t know about you but that looks good asf tho
Uncle roger: <b>&quot;I love when guga alway so happy&quot;</b><br><br><b>*Happy guga mode*</b>
"Calling out Naruto fans, as should be done 😉"
There is nothing an American chef can´tr eff up!
If you use cheap cuts using an acidic marinade ( pineapple ) will help soften the meat. Just be careful not to let it marinade for too long. Pork being the toughest so you need about 10 hours<br>Chicken about 1 - 2 hours. Fish only 20 minutes since its extremely soft
"When u see the white miso, they said no msg, I wonder how uncle roger will react to this"
Uncle roger said Naruto is basic but like at My Hero Acidamia
Is suppose to be white only 💀 <br>Its not suppose to be to dark 💀
"MSG don&#39;t leave you? Damn, it&#39;s like swallowing chewing gum? Just stays up in there?"
"It go to white to black, opposite to Michael Jackson💀"
It went white to black must be Uncle Ruckus
This is “Naruto” lol not “last air bender” 😂😂😂
Un le Roger ur video must be longer 😢
Sorry children for bondage joke is funny bc he just advocated for beating them 😂🤣😂
naruto is my favorote anime u should reweiew one peice cooking
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=410"">6:50</a>: ._."
Naruto cant eat even.. goku solos him in eating contest.. 😅
Lmaooo. Awesome video. Love every second of it
The amount of racism💀He&#39;s not afraid bruh..
&quot;MSG don&#39;t leave you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Am I a joke to you?&quot; - The Human Digestive System
I’m from Guatemala and I love chicken feet soup. And I’m not ashamed to admit it.
"when I see a happy uncle Roger, I achieve inner peace"
Uncle roger &#39; What is MSG ? &#39;
Collab with auntie kea plz
Congratulations for 8 million subscribers ❤
Naruto after seeing this: dattebayooooooo
What’s wrong with Coldplay their good. At least don’t compare them to Jamie Oliver
Uncle Roger!Can you do a review of Sanji&#39;s Navy curry with rice or his meat on a bone recipe from One piece?
Didn&#39;t realise it was GUGA! I am excited now
Michael Jackson faced ailments so that’s why his skin turned white. Quite disappointed at you uncle roger
He’s racist 😢
HE SHOULD HAVE USED MSG 🧂
Like MRE Steve... What is his concern about getting thirsty or &quot;thirst provoking&quot; as he says eating food. It&#39;s pretty weird... Who the hell doesn&#39;t get thirsty or drink when eating.
Why can&#39;t Guga pronounce &quot;Mirin&quot;? There&#39;s no &quot;Y&quot; in the word.
"Roge, boiling water doesn&#39;t kill miso... Who told you that?"
Nick can&#39;t cook. He&#39;s as bad as Jamie Oliver and ruined that lobster. He turned a lobster roll into mayo and tuna... GEEZUS that kid can&#39;t cook and you called him &quot;uncle&quot;... He&#39;s 12...
You don&#39;t have a nice house because you live in a place even worse than Canada or California... &quot;Rich&quot; 😂🤣 get real. Why would you live in the UK? Why... Hell no.
Smoke is way better than brazing... C&#39;mon
If you say you have a &quot;favorite anime&quot; and you&#39;re over 24 you&#39;re already wrong in life and need to lay off the weed.
Bad enough you live in the UK you change your VPN location to Canada? ... 😂 I&#39;m starting to think you love Jamie.
Chickens have onlykfc and that&#39;s ok and not of
is it just me or do I hear the voice of emotional damage?
chicken feet is good with alcohol here in philippines
"aroma oil is not the necessary indeed. For IEKEI Ramen, it is a must but for TONKOTSU Ramen from Kyushu, I dont think it is always on it. Also adding miso is certainly making the broth into miso taste but not tonkotsu. Oh btw, they really forgot, is the MSG."
"Uncle Roger says don&#39;t use the word penetrate for cooking, it is very sexual and also him uses it two seconds later."
chicken feet is my childhood fav meal bc im asian
&quot;The Hub&quot; 💀
hyaaaa
i am asian but i don&#39;t like chicken feet
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=412"">6:52</a> le indians😑🤢"
To be fair to Guga about the broth tho the broth looks brown in the anime too so if anything the anime fucked up
"I&#39;m not a cook but how are pork bones hard to find? Buy pork, cook, eat, bones, done. What is there only boneless where some people live?"
When I do my origami projects I love the rolling I have to do at each step.
Where is Nigel’s Restaurant?
I can tell by the look it was good not to bad  and u express like it was shit... brother restrain yourself little bit he saying I&#39;m trying to make a good noodle😅😅😅😅
Nah Naruto ain’t basic it’s mainstream for a reason uncle roger
I never seen one person marinate food after cooking in America...
Since when do we marinate meat AFTER it&#39;s cooked?
Haiyaa!!!😅
I like how he called out the Naruto thing.Far as it&#39;s like basic anime 101. HxH is the way
Chicken feet has a lot of fat
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=454"">7:34</a> nick trippin"
"Has anyone had good experience with those noodles, maybe its me but they seem too &quot;cold&quot; or too stiff? I may snot have ever cooked them properly"
Please review ranveer brar
Coldplay slaps! Haiya uncle roger
food is food if it does taste good I&#39;ll eat it
can we talk about both naruto and menma(naruto alternate version) are related with ramen lmfao
“That my only foot fetish” 😂😂😂
LOL you win good
"roger naruto is the best fucking anime dont ever diss it, or i will come for you..- ."
"Looks nice, i would like to try that, once. But im not quite sure about MSG, we just use that for fattening animals."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> had me laughing"

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=397"">6:37</a> what about m.s.g."
DID U COMPARE NARUTO TO JAMIE OLIVER?????
no way i just hypothetically say a rabbit dying in a rebels icecream ad before this video. i really wanted to bring this up
I thought I was very racist for thinking Uncle roger and nigel looked similar.. now I know why.
Are u chief?..
Chickeny pork lol something a mexican would say lol
Btw to all the islamics no pork is not halal even bbq&#39;d pork
My friend at school try’s to pretend he’s you😂
ok then pronoun video properly
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=315"">5:15</a> &quot;not last air bender&quot; 😂😂"
Moving house BS 😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=107"">1:47</a><br>Is him a chef?!"
"I love this and the comentary on both pronouciation and form, but when he said &quot;its not a race its a marathon&quot;, its in refernce to a marathon often taking a long time to complete because of the long distance, but it being rewarding when you do finish, where a race is more like wok cooking, fast, hot, and done quickly."
How can you insult Coldplay by placing them with Jamie? Did they cook wrong too?😮
Love from Nepal
How to make Ramen in over an hour! <br>Lol
Naruto is deep as hell
"Uncle Roger is lying, Netflix cannot open once connected to Express VPN"
"Every time Roger sees anything change color, you know the Michael Jackson joke is coming."
"As naruto and coldplay fans i feel so called out, fuck."
"love you uncle roger. however, don&#39;t mess with the Naruto Fandom!"
Uncle Roger .. Naruto&#39;s not basic 😭
"Naruto being favorite anime is still greater than Jamie Oliver being a favorite chef..at least don&#39;t compare this great anime to him just to make a poor joke out of it, at which u failed again"
You say that it&#39;s backwards but if you have IBS it&#39;s actually a lot better if you do bedroom - get ready for date - dinner - go home and watch a movie and cuddle. Way better. 😅😏😉
mf asked for pork and aksed if it was halal
Dont compare naruto with Jaime oliver
Not him cooking dem chicken feet without cutting off the nails
I think this roger only good at critic. But cannot cook
Uncle roger pls sanji food review
"The expression is; it’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon."
Can i get half uncle title i buyed 3 merche
Nick DiGiovanni and uncle Roger are the best dynamic duo
I may be colored but I love chicken feet

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=398"">6:38</a> Uncle Roger forgot M.S.G"
"now i know why that guy punched you in the face, you called naruto basic"
I realized what he was missing...<br><br><br>M<br>S<br>G
also in Japan you don&#39;t carefully slurp the ramen you INHALE IT piping hot SLUUUURP the slurp cools it down
And saying that unlcle Roger love other anime that also means that uncle Roger is basic bc Naruto is top 3 best anime
Uncle Roger: u see button u press<br>Me: oke<br><b>Press nuclear button</b>
Whats wrong with  naruto seconde most populare anime 1 dbz 2 naruto 3one piece 4pokemon

Uncle roger you know pork is haram
"Guga, do your research on who loves chicken feet because a lot of Asians love chicken feet."
Who even dare to barbeque Chashu? It&#39;s braised.
Who in Asia own a smoker? Those who do raise your hand.
"&quot;where to buy packet rice&quot; search 🤣🤣🤣 Got to admit, an entertaining ad is a pleasure to watch 👍"
i swear chicken feet is the best
Finally I know what the pink spiral thingy is!

"Why the hell does everyone say Bloody Nauto as a favourite Anime, Naruto is sool shit, I much prefer Black Lagoon as an Anime"
"Nice roasting man 😂👌 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=286"">4:46</a>"
Naruto&#39;s favourite ramen is miso ramen though.
They guy from the end of the video has the voice of Peter Griffin
"As an Asian, we don&#39;t care if it tasty or not. Food is food"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=167"">2:47</a> uncle roger i love you, but no<br>always marinate before you cook, only marinate after in some very specific circumstances"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=91"">1:31</a> Correct, but not 100% accurate. <br>Su - When speaking, make your lips like a kiss.<br>Tsu - When speaking, make your mouth smile and show your teeth<br>It&#39;s really hard to explain by typing."
Okay if he did it so bad why don&#39;t you make it
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=523"">8:43</a>  <br>uncle roger have you seen the bottom right at the first soybean paste"

When i say the bts reference to  the song fire i literally shoute &quot;ohhh&quot;😂😃
"Repent to Jesus Christ “That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”<br>‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭12‬:‭10‬ ‭NIV‬‬<br>D"
I love it when you say &#39;he love to play with fire &#39;and started to play BTS &#39;Fire&#39;. Love you 爱你❤
When American make asian food<br>Asian : &quot;what the f... Is he doing?&quot;
Isn&#39;t 3 hours marinade for the eggs too little? I though it was more like 3 days
Poor uncle roger and his &quot;buttons&quot;😂
Naruto fans after seeind this video : you shall know pain
God why does the Charsu looks like Sio Be/Siew Mai
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=100"">1:40</a> true😅"
Did he say he added miriam???? HAHAHAHAHA
"jajajajajaja es naruto, no el avatar XD"
the iconic hiyaaa
I get that Guga is Cuban but you can&#39;t just pronounce all this Japanese stuff in Spanish lol the way he refers to mirin as &quot;miriam&quot; kinda drives me crazy
U can make a pig look like a chicken
im a kid in my mum account and when u say sorry children i get so confused why
bro why the heck is uncle roger sponsored by the SAME FREAKING APP EVERY VIDEO?!
i/like/your/voice/from/china
Plot Twist: <b>Uncle Roger was actually born in Boston.</b> 😂
bro why do i hear him say expressppn
Me who lives in dubai and uses ETISALAT be like: um it’s illegal to use a VPN in duba
BY THE WAY HALAL FOOD IS NON PORK OR SLCOHOL OR SOMTHING LIKE THAT
Uncle R. knows his anime and his rock taste seems to be also good.
did people make onlyhen joke already?
Marathon IS race!
Need to get a guy to be a Donald Trump and can say wrong everything the do something you don&#39;t like and then when they do good he can say it&#39;s the best everyone says it&#39;s the best I don&#39;t say that but everyone tells me it&#39;s the best
You got me to sub pretty quickly not time to binge 😂 man so funny and cooks great
This chef is really biased for trying to copy a japanese anime fictional bowl of ramen. Textbook weeb that cant pronounce anything right or use the right ingredients

Btw I thought u were gonna say msg not aroma oil
"Aroma oil is just pork fat. I cooke sesame oil with bacon fat and boom, every loves it. <br><br>Free game, you&#39;re welcome."
Misoveryexpensive 😂
"Why is he criticizing marinating uncooked meat? I think Uncle Roger has that the wrong way round. <br>Also,  Char siu - Chashu, pretty much the same word, at least sound nearly identical, so maybe they&#39;re somewhat interchangeable? I&#39;ll give that they are from different places, so there are probably slightly different ways of cooking"
"i know char sui isnt japanese, but in the anime subtitles, that&#39;s what it said"
I challenge you to a fist fight Uncle Roger for saying Naruto be basic!
"Damn Nigel is so hot, hard to concentrate on the content sometimes tbh"
Naruto !
My hubby and I love msg in a lot of our cooking. But some people I know complain that it gives them migranes. So we only use it when cooking for ourselves.
Don’t you like aunty ester

The original video he is reviewing has cringe english.. i hate that accent can’t stand it.. spanish to english butchered in translation ughk
Now all my best friends does at school during every conversation is &quot;haiya&quot;
"Narutos favorite ramen is Tonkotsu with extra Chashu. That&#39;s all he&#39;s ever stated. So he doesn&#39;t like Miso, or Shoyu. He likes the Pork bone broth. As any sane person should."
For super flavor and more white broth add more hen 😊❤ trust me
Tonkazu in italian is dick 😂😂😂😂
Hi
Naruto Ramen doesn’t have aromatic oil tho<br>Because Aromatic oil doesn’t exist in cartoons and anime <br>They just copy paste food
Yousaid penetrate for cooking
Uncle Roger
The egg in mandrin name is 茶叶蛋lol
I am learning a lot by watching your video<br>How to insult people 😆<br>Hieaaaaaaa👌😃😏
Me never take Ramen in my life
"If you feel thirsty after putting MSG, that means you put too much MSG in your dish. Always remember, MSG is a kind of salt that does not taste salty. You can not put MSG like other spices, think about how salty it will be if you put the same amount of salt."
Emotinal damage!
I love how this reaction video has more views  than the actual video
Bro you are dumb that is naruto ramen
Bro really just corrected the meat guy how to make meat
Not the fuckkin chicken legs💀💀💀
Bamboo shoot full in tripura how much u want. Uncle roger

Little remainder<br>Uncle Roger: if you get thirsty just drink water
I&#39;ll never get over the guy asking you if BBQ pork is halal.
We’re making tonkotsu ramen but instead of pork bones we’ll be using miso.
Okay is pork halal? What the flip dude. Its like every human on the world dont know about it
It went from white to black opposite of Michael Jackson 😂😂😂 he did him so dirty
Life lessons inside 💠
Dude. You&#39;re through... Naruto is amazing. Coldplay is not basic. Coldplay is just suck. You can&#39;t compare Naruto to this. And do not even start with Jamie Oliver. He doesn&#39;t even know how to cook.
My fav anime Is GANTZ.  Get cultured you uncultured swine!! HAIIIYAAAAAAA!
As a astronomer I respect him having the pillars of creation on his background
"NO BEATING KID INFLUENCE. NO, UNCLE ROGER. NO MORE BAD RECOMENDATION STEREOTYPES."
"Wait, who marinates AFTER cooking???"
So that’s why Naruto was called Menma in that movie. <b>*mind blown astrophysicist gif*</b>
&quot;you want the same color as obama not wesley snipe&quot; got me dying
joco te szartal pako
He couldn&#39;t find any pork bones??? You don&#39;t have to go to butcher for that. Local grocery store

Don&#39;t say penetrate...... Few seconds  later .....you use word penetrate yourself 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh.... i thought the element recipe was MSG
I have never watched Uncle Roger and not laughed.
Lol I don&#39;t think Naruto likes miso ramen.. it&#39;s probably shoyu ramen
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=175"">2:55</a> ain&#39;t that bad imo👀"

If you forgot aroma oil you will dead and go to hell and has personality like uncle rocringy
"My family love chicken feet in <br>vinegar, patitas de pollo en vinagre, It’s more like a snack"
There&#39;s no msg in miso haiyaa

Uncle Roger not sigma becuz he disrespect Michel Jackson
Emotional damage
"What does MSG do to your brain?<br><br>For starters, it acts as a neurotransmitter — a chemical substance that stimulates nerve cells to transmit signals ( 1 , 2 ). Some studies claim that MSG can lead to brain toxicity by causing excessive glutamate levels in the brain to overstimulate nerve cells, resulting in cell death ( 2 , 7 )."
"broth color was off it’s supposed to look pleasing. As my korean corporate executive chef said wisely “you eat with your eyes before you eat with your mouth.” Too dark he could fix it by lightening the broth, not burning the broth, real ramen thick, eggs overparred, no great hot sauce and other sauces to scoop over at the end per bite."
also yes in the fridge then pull it out and either get a quick dip or quickly flash it
no need to split use a mallet one hit in the middle if its too uneven (usually in the center) then roll like a champ
"im a northern asian chef from america and the biggest thing i find is not using the right kind of oil. A wok is made to be able to be screaming hot and olive oil, canola, or any oil that is not the correct asian type for said dish you immediately are making a mutt dish."
i bet i know the huge problem and its quite possibly oil
Guga: If you don’t have a smoker…<br>Me waiting for alternative <br>Guga: …you should get one

"Umm, but like, I&#39;ve definitely had better Raman before and I have your accent, litterally."
"The fact that I&#39;m Asian too and I totally agree with everything Uncle Roger said is ...creepy, kinda."
Why are you judjing him his good cooker
By removing water after boiling you losing flavour! I can make perfect clear stock without it ! Check your data
uncle you love msg but it is unhealty .. flavor ok but  health no
The most offensive part of the video is HOW LONG IT TAKES THEM TO START EATING.
Char siuuuu
&quot;Chicken feet is my only foot fetish&quot;

i&#39;m American but I like chicken feet
Fuyooooo
Uncle roger you should make a video and show us how to properly make Naruto’s ramen noodles
This Naruto… not Airbender! 😂<br>Same color as Obama… not Wesley Snipes! 🤣
Don&#39;t compare Naruto with Jamie Olive Oil :/
Also South Africans love chicken feet
Stop talking eat nowwww🤣🤣
when guga said who likes chicken feet:<br>my heart:💔
Thirst over msg words to live by
When uncle Roger said &quot;Look at the juices its still squirting out ooh!&quot; I literally had to clean my brain!
"Uncle Roger those noodles are all you can get in some places!!! It took me FOREVER to find fresh noodles in Seattle, and even now I can only get Udon and Soba. <br><br>That said, I keep that shit stocked these days. 🤣"
i see like button so i press
Uncle Roger I&#39;m not rich and my husband decided to buy himself a smoker and it&#39;s been the best thing since you ain&#39;t had nothing until you&#39;ve had Thanksgiving turkey out of a smoker

Is tonkutsu made from a pork bone broth?
Everyone marinates before cooking wtf?
"I never comment on anything, but to compare the master piece named Naruto, to your nemesis Jamie Oliver is just wrong in so many levels. I took it a bit personally"
"Uncle Roger, Is High As Shit."
Msg don’t leave you
"Stop with the close up , why you wanna show everyone you phucccup"
This is why I hate weeabo videos. They say this is traditional Japanese then they go on to do a bunch of things that are not even Japanese things. <br>Roger is always right.
You same like thagesh YouTube because he will be do like content this please watch him Hindi Indian

"I like chicken feet, fun at a dim sum"
kutos to that spacebar for withstanding all those aggresive pauses
"The best part of this video, ended became a collab after an year. 👏🏿👏🏿"
"Stop being so critical uncle, he said he was doing his own take on something else so it&#39;s not the original recipe"
"Haven seen it yet, 10 bucks says uncle roger complains about no msg or not enough msg"
rasist
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=173"">2:53</a><br>That like bringing woman to bedroom, than buy them dinner.<br><br>nice dating advice, so i gonna buy dinner first. then take her to bedroom. and ask her to fix this leaky spot on the roof. thats how guys."
"My god, uncle roger is teaching me more than cooking class at school"
@Uncle Roger... One Day You Will Make Indian Chicken Biryani. ‘Deal or Not”
Guga foods need to add msg
"Love, how he used BTS&#39; Fire💜💜🤣🤣"
Uncle Roger disrespected naruto by comparing it to jamie Oliver being your favourite chef.
When msg heard that uncle Roger say he like rice cooker and nigela:you cheating!!!!
"Well, we don&#39;t actually like chicken feet. Its just affordable."
Smokers are totally worth it! I am obsessed with mine
I tried using a VPN earlier and Hulu shut it down and wouldn’t let me watch anything until I turn it off
“Who loves chicken feet??”<br>Me: dam the stupidest question ever
The most funniest and informative video ever!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=577"">9:37</a> i will always remember this next time i make marinade"
Uncle roger the judge
Who needs a smoker just let my brother cook
"Loving Jamie Oliver, as your favorite chef is not common. It is rare."
Shut roger
Uh its his first take so yeah
"He did something to the bamboo shoots, from can to finishing. He skipped this explanation. &quot;Menma&quot; does not come out of the can."
The commercial came on right when he said I mean honestly who loves chicken feet and Uncle Roger started to freak out and that&#39;s when the commercial came on and I didn&#39;t even get to hear his response but I was already cracking up at his face and reaction
Look uncle he had to inprovice
Uncle roger can you review <br>MAX THE MEAT GUY <br>Gordon Ramsay <br>GUGA FOODS / GUGA <br>Nick d Giovanni<br>BETCH <br>More ...<br><br>and see if they can get the uncle title  start from the worst to the best .
"Comments on food is fair game but calling naruto basic clearly shows how little you understand of naruto, its popularity and continuity has a solid and core reason, its a shame because i normally find you comedy well received"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=420"">7:00</a><br>hungarians also love chicken feet in soup"
Rolling newspaper is so true
I was so happy when I say fire when he said Guga loves playing with fire 😂 tbh I thought he would put the Playing with fire song by Blackpink 😂❤💜💜💜
"Idk i think saying your favorite anime is one piece is way more basic, its like saying your favorite game is call of duty or your favorite food is pizza"
Normies: MSG = Monosodium Glutamate<br><br>Nieces and nephews: MSG = Make Shit Good
if that standard is low then call me poor as FUCK
This Naruto not Last Air Bender 🤣 I freaking love his humour
Chicken only fan 😆😆. Uncle Roger you are amazing!!!!

"Uncle Roger, smokers are amazing! You need one in your life."

Last airbender IS NOT A ANIME IT&#39;S A CARTOON!!!!
"Guga ain&#39;t the only one wrong in this vid, Avatar the Last Airbender isn&#39;t anime"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=353"">5:53</a> &quot;It&#39;s not a race, it&#39;s a marathon.&quot;<br>A marathon is a race.🤣🤣🤣🤣 <br><br>It was supposed to be sprint not a marathon."
The way guga talks is very…annoying
last air bender is not ANIME
I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t comment on his calling mirin &quot;Miriam.&quot; That&#39;s way more wrong than char siu
My Demonslayer a** today we’re cooking the kamado family with muzan

Haram 0/10
I really like gagu foods😄❤️
SOMETIMES I FORGET NIGEL IS UNCLE ROGER I ALWAYS THINK UNCLE ROGER IS SOMEONE ELSE HAHAHA
Uncle Roger I don&#39;t eat egg but with holy msg my taste buds goes boom boom
Can still say bone marrow good for soup but that chicken feet pls remove that nail.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=78"">1:18</a><br>Ad ends"
"Guga: “And remember this. Its not a race, but it is a marathon.”<br>Uncle Roger:🤨 “A marathon is race…”<br><br>😂 I think Guga meant to say, “It’s a marathon, not a sprint.”<br>But Uncle Roger casually pointing out the mistake was too good 😂"
"I watch alot of uncle roger, and i don&#39;t agree with the msg. I&#39;m team salt. WHEN it comes to flavour...<br>Fuck msg, go with the OG."
Uncle Roger switching to his normal pronounciation should be a hub category.
"dont penetrate, marinate"
i really like chicken feet they are so good
to be fair i&#39;d love to be taken to bed 1st then  order food while in bed (sounds like a fun time)
"Guga doesn&#39;t beat his kids, he dry age&#39;s them."
I know Uncle Roger didn&#39;t compare Naruto to JAMIE FREAKIN OLIVER🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
lol I always buy that dry ramen from NTUC and have to admit it&#39;s good
要先炒過肉才熬湯啊，竟然沒罵
"I&#39;m starting to feel more confident, I&#39;ve learned enough wrongs...Probably....Maybe a few more ramen critiques..."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=232"">3:52</a> bad uncle Roger bad bad uncle Roger bad"
&quot;One guy said it&#39;s like chickeny pork and the other guy said it taste like fire...still don&#39;t know what it tastes like.&quot; Bruh that got me laughing hard.
Uncle Roger! Come to Miami!! Do a Collab with Guga! (Sorry for shouting)
Haiyaaaaaa
Uncle Roger you said espress vpn
Only critisizing
i akways thirst for msg
PACKET RICE!????? nah u better keep that thing to yourself 😤
So better idea is to braise the pork and then marinate? Do I cut the meat and marinate the slices or marinate it whole?
I’m Asian but I don’t like chicken feet
Thats a perfect ramen but u still complain 🤷‍♂️
"Uncle Roger. ALL internet traffic, VPN or otherwise, still has to go through Internet Service Provider. so now two lots of data collection. Both can be suppoened to hand over records. with the vpn option, they can choose to sell or give away information anyway. check the terms and conditions. VPN is worse as 3rd parties now have your login credentials to any site you visit and your card payment details and full access to your computer. Haaiya 🤭"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=306"">5:06</a> he is using flre ball justu"
"hey u mispronounced tonkotsu its tonkatsu <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=506"">8:26</a>"
Your fav food is MSG
i am your biggggg fan i like your content very much but no jokes on naruto
Zuko&#39;s face be like the pork lol
"I feel like we need a cook off between Roger, Guga and Ramsey. 🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>.<br>A steak cook off...."
Roger jealous he don&#39;t have a smoker. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My favourite anime is YuYu hakusho and rurouni kenshin
Opposite of Michael Jackson had me dying
Don&#39;t Thirst over women thirst over msg need to be on t shirt 👌
The Obama and Wesley comparison is too much uncle ☠️☠️🤣but I shall be using it as a point if reference from now o
He said he made it as authentic as he can while adding ingredients that he just personally like instead of sticking to the original ingredients the proper way of cooking it.
so uncle roger what is the best aroma oil for Naruto Ramen?
"omg! Even indian knows you put miso chunk through filter, not tooo much it can melt you stomach due to high salt content."
Only thing i dont like about this uncle is that he doesnt like naruto
"Please review <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jok7VlJxjos"">https://youtu.be/Jok7VlJxjos</a>"
ไอ่หย่าาา
Hey I&#39;m no pro chef but marinade is a before cooking activity it soaks in the flavor into a normally less flavorful meat. Meat isn&#39;t naturally crazy flavorful also I know people who threw shit togeather to make a smoker.
Also he went overboard on the amount of kombu in the dashi... Probably one of the reasons why the broth was so dark...
Uncle roger forgor to put msg into his rice cooker Nigela ramen
We found new ramen guy
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=632"">10:32</a> - Uncle Roger: Fishcakes...<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=645"">10:45</a> - Also Uncle Roger: It got MSG inside? FUIYOH!"
Haha very funny 8/10
I&#39;ve never wanted to subscribe to somebody so quickly after the first video.<br><br>I wish you were my uncle 😂
&quot;Not last Air Bender!&quot; 😂😂😭😭💀
"Good good good uncle roger , u watched last airbender . Ur fan is happy and content now"
As uncle Roger once said &quot;don&#39;t say penetrate say marinate&quot; so that&#39;s why I&#39;m gonna make my new name jester marinate
"If Gordan Ramsay was Asian, we have a great representation here right in front of us..."
I loved chicken feet specially if deep fry it... Filipino here
Opposite of MJ💀
&quot;One guy describes as Chickeny Pork and one guy describes as Fire. I still don&#39;t know what it taste like.&quot; Best line ever. Every time I watch these food reviews I realize that so many exaggerate what they taste leaving me wondering what does it really actually taste like. Just say its salty or sweet or sour or something lol.
I hate menama why is is there?
Which ones better Naruto or Last Airbender
haha
Char suiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
"uncle roger, we all love you but don&#39;t compare Naruto to Jamie Oliver, at least the creators of<br>the show have good taste in egg fried rice."
Wait wait wait wait wait<br>Someone got marinated by a knife
Guga you&#39;re the best. This roger here is sickening. Not funny at all.
All this rage about Ramen causes me to order it once. I still don&#39;t get what all the fuss is about. I dont like mu food drowning.
Avatar: The Last Airbender is anime. Uncle Roger confirmed 👍
And with no aromaoil
I give Dislike because i do not like the eggs with no pepper
which is better nord VPN or express VPN
I agree as a asian that chicken feet are godtier and i got offended a bit but its okay
"I&#39;d love for Uncle Roger to review a Miso Soup recipe. I wanted to make it for my family, and I ended up patching together three or four different recipes. It tasted good, but I have no idea what to do to make it better"
loved your BTS fire shoutout......
Your nephew looks a LOT like you 🤨 you sure it was just auntie Helen shouting the wrong name?
What is halal<br>Halal means space in my languge so i always get confused
"Also see that after splitting the meat, that is zero marinade penetrating it."
Thank you&lt;&lt;
Element smg
When he said sorry children I am. Child 😳😳😳
This guy just found all different ways to fuck up the Ramen broth from the start.
Guga must be a fire man  that&#39;s why he loves fire
Im from the Caribbean and I love chicken feet
Not tonkotsu  its ichiraku
"“He went from white to black, opposite of Michael Jackson”<br>Uncle roger has no filer 💀💀💀"
I agree with what you said about the miso. Boiling miso also kills the good bacteria or probiotics in the miso that is actually very good for our gut health.
He got jokes 😆😆😆😆🤣 love it!👍
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=188"">3:08</a> it would have been funnier if the food was from demon slayer"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=419"">6:59</a> maybe it can 🤔"
Our family just had chicken-feet adobo yesterday. We love it.
"Saying Naruto is your favorite anime is more like saying Linkin Park is your favorite band. Definitely deserves all the respect for they did in their prime, but the legacy has been questioned and debated."
guga racist
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=250"">4:10</a> IS SORRY CHILDREN AGAINNN"
Guga is the only one that kept his uncle title
Guga&#39;s voice just bothers me for some reason. I have no idea why.
"My friends watch Naruto a lot so if they don’t know how to make Naruto Ramen then, Haiyah!"
"Guga cook everything like grilling, smoking or BBQ, so pre-marinating and stuff. I don&#39;t think its an issue because he tell you its his take on this but Uncle Roger a comedian so its not really food criticism anyways."
Yo Uncle roger should react to the first few episodes of naruto.
"&quot;this Naruto, not last Airbender&quot;<br><br>Avatar isn&#39;t anime😂"
uncle roger remember your brother lenny we told him no more dating util marraige now he cant even cook rice<br><br>Steven He
"He makes it all about the meat, when it&#39;s really just a topping"
Naruto best anime shut up
"My japanese teacher taught me always follow the sa shi su se so order when cooking, it&#39;s sugar salt vinegar soy sauce and Miso if do it wrong the flavor and smell will fuck up."
So not talking about the build quality and also no screen protector imagine all the dust just sitting between the screens when closed in your pocket
Ice Cream tasting bland? MSG!<br>Bubble tea taste mid? Msghehe<br>8==D tasting fishy? mSg
Bro dont compare naruto to jamie oliver naruto is way better than jamie in fact even sakura might be jamie olivers sister cuz she always fu** up everything
You disrespect anime avatar is not anime
"What sucks is that I, a 12 year old, made egg fried rice, with a wok, but it took forever to find msg, but I found it, using wang gang’s recipe"
"Uncle roger review a steak master’s ramen. And reviewed a pro chef, who failed ramen, making steak"
Bamboo shoot is hard to find outside of Japan ?
Msg is  one  of  favorite  things  now.  Thanks  uncle  Roger.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC4wuOcijmQ&amp;t=318"">5:18</a> avatar is not even an anime smh"
"just react naa, why so trash talking mannn. haiyaaaaaaaa very annoying man"
Soup
I’m Australian but when i went to bali and i had chicken feet they were AMAZING i wanted them everyday cause of the taste and flavour they had
Naruto  Ramen makes  me  want  to  Naruto  run off a building.
The real sin of this video is calling avatar an anime
Uncle roger is Obito
Why does steven and uncle sound the same🤨🤔
uncle roger can&#39;t even cook like this but is quick to judge LoL starting to annoy me
He literally just said penetrate
It needs msg
Cum
"no YOU have it wrong way around, you ONLY marinate BEFORE cooking, you literally CANT marinade after cooking, it just doesn&#39;t work, NO ONE does that. that would be &quot;dressing&quot; or &quot;saucing&quot;"
&quot;I wish chicken could start only fans&quot; dam couldn&#39;t have said it better
Me into the first 30 seconds: ISTG if he say it&#39;s MSG I will lose my mind<br><br>Update: ok it&#39;s aroma oil
Hey Uncle Roger come rate my homemade ramen 😆
"one word, HAIYA"
Uncle Roger knows his anime!!
I like how his computer background is the pillars of life
i never eat MSG
U sound like steven he
Did you see t
msg is good but salty
