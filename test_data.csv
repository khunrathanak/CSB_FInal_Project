Using boiled and reusing oil like the guy from the 2nd place is extremely harmful and can cause cancer over time
"I love to live vicariously through your many food adventures, and it&#39;s amazing to watch you share so many foods from various cultures! Thank you for repping Hong Kong where my family is from! Your Cantonese pronunciation is also on point, so amazing job! I also love your on-point description of what Wok Hei means, it&#39;s spot on!"
PLEASE DO A FOOD TOUR IN CHINA!🇨🇳
Show how a family can eat for $100
First meal looks Grose. Even though I am on the carnivore diet I till like to watch the show. I sti;; cook other food for my wife and kids. But I am so much healthier now I will never go back to a omnivore diet.
WOW
Man got served chilly chicken at last for 42 dollars😂
"Hong Kong is not cheap! It’s expensive, over crowded and very humid! I hated it when I was there, always sweating as it was so hot and very humid! The stall owners are ride at the markets! I wanted to eat traditional yum cha where they wheel the food to you, I couldn’t find it anywhere where I was staying which was central! Then I had to ask the hotel for help. To my surprise the staff told me that that don’t eat from the wheeling yum cha’s as that is seen as lower class, that they only eat from restaurants and you order the foods. So she recommended the restaurant to go to! I went there, food was ok but I didn’t like the atmosphere and the bill was quite expensive! I was surprised as I thought these yum cha places would be everywhere! Never again!"
Im from utah USA. Wish i knew you were in HK the last few days. We were just there for the last week and left today. Lol.

"In that second place, everything is fried using the same oil. Allergic to shrimp but ordered chicken kidney. Hope you have your meds and transportation to the nearest hospital."
damn...Hong Kong&#39;s food is expensive<br>everything u ate here is available at Malaysia with the same price different currency
You can just eat the whole shrimp. It&#39;s crispy enough to chew.
I was in hk in 1988..I got a cup of watermelon juice for 30cents..drank in the bar fir 3 hours ..cost 20 for 9 screwdrivers..
Funny I&#39;m watching this at the hk airport 😂
Kind of lame. Tonnes of real street food in Hong Kong and this is all your tour guide brought you? Fail
"HK is an amazing place, you can find all different country food here!! enjoy your stay &amp; eat more!! I wish I can go back to HK and just eat..."
it took me 2 episodes to realize virginia&#39;s company name is a wordplay on cloudy with a chance of meatballs
The first meal filled me up.. lol
sonny always has sly disses
Rip off!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OZyRM3PMG4"">0:00</a> the mammogram pose…"
"Why is it expensive? $18 for a plate of shrimp? man, that would hurt my wallet"

you spoilt this video by titling it &quot;We Finally Did It&quot;
I miss eating at these places in hk….
Shout out to the prep chef! What would we do without em

"When the tour guide isn&#39;t eating, major SUS vibes!"
Hope I can be a help you in your next streetfood venture in HK or even in Philippines 😉
HK is completely different now than 10years ago
"I love it how the man is cooking with his singlet 😅 classic Asian love it! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23proud2beasian"">#proud2beasian</a> ❤"
WHY ISNT SHE EATING! She needs to eat too!
Overpriced hahaha not worth it
Virginia is like a companion AI hahaha
😊
Holy crap the food in this episode was expensive! Easy to reach $100 when it is food equally costly that I can&#39;t justify purchasing in the USA.
street food isn&#39;t that cheap in HK
Asian breakfast is my late night dinner
"arteries are hardening as we speak,,, rip"
"WWF-Hong Kong’s DNA study reveals that almost 90% of eel products sold in restaurants across Hong Kong are critically endangered or endangered species; of which nearly 50% of the samples are identified as critically endangered European eel (Anguilla anguilla), implying that potentially illegal species are prevailing in Hong Kong’s eel supply chains. <br> <br>Eel products, including roasted eel and sushi, were collected from 80 randomly selected licensed sushi restaurants from May to June 2020. All samples were examined at The University of Hong Kong for DNA analysis by Dr David Baker’s team from the University’s Conservation Forensics laboratory. Among the 80 samples subjected to the DNA test, 36 samples (45%) were confirmed to be critically endangered European eel, a further 29 samples (36%) and 5 samples (6%) were endangered American eel and Japanese eel respectively."
"I&#39;m just here to tell Sony, you don&#39;t need these click bait type of thumbnails. You are big please."
This is the first episode I seen where all the food looked disgusting 😅 bro must have my dogs immune system cause he’ll eat whatever too
Actually I am from Hawaii and we love spam… rich and poor … 🙄
Virginiaaaaaa...she doesn&#39;t know 😆
U are a bad person
U are a bad person
"This is the 99 cent store temu version of the much missed Anthony Bourdain,.<br>This guy...never worked in a kitchen, doesn&#39;t know shit about food and Lacks charisma, insight,and brings nothing to food culture/history 🎉"
Bro this was just perfection. I grew up in the 80&#39;s. Would have loved to see an X-men movie 80&#39;s style.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OZyRM3PMG4&amp;t=192"">3:12</a>lol I’m pretty sure junkie comfort food is called Fentanyl"
Shrimp omelette fried in thousand year oil
Sonny you&#39;ve great sense of humor 😂😂
lmao sonnys hilarious
Where is Suzuka 😢
Virginia is so adorable ❤❤
"As someone who lived in Hong Kong for almost 2 decades, make sure you have both Hep A and Hep B vaccinations if you are eating in these types of places. A lot of my friends both locals and expats got sick with Hepatitis from eating in such places. I got very lucky and didn&#39;t get either but that was just dumb luck and I should have been vaccinated instead but I just never considered that I would need to be (as the first country I lived in in Asia was Japan and I didn&#39;t need any additional vaccinations to go to Japan from Europe)."
"To be fair, a bunch of shops say at Jardine&#39;s Bazaar are basically serving street food - its just a basic shop coverage on it."
"Cigarette smoking chef also has random arm band-aids.  Real dive dinner chef vibes... like Mel, the cook from Alice."
Food looks amazing and cheap! Great video as always man. Stay safe out there.✌️❤️😊
hope you enjoyed the gutter oil
That&#39;s what Jimmy O Yang was talking about.
"For Asia, that food is NOT cheap!"
There’s a sexual tension here🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OZyRM3PMG4&amp;t=645"">10:45</a> b...b...but i thought the shrimp have full of shit in their head, isn&#39;t it ?"
I miss the tropical food days 😭😭
Why is Virginia not eating? That&#39;s very weird.
"OVER 100 DOLLARS FOR SHRIMP, CHICKEN AND EEL LOL RIP OFF"
"Got to admit, the food looked pretty good.  On a side note sorry Sonny, haven&#39;t been able to quite get myself to pull the trigger on your monkey Phillipine vid😢"
"Is it hot there? Wondering why Sonny wears long sleeves and a vest? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OZyRM3PMG4&amp;t=319"">5:19</a> why  does he look like a UPS driver? Asking for a friend who is a UPS driver."
Omg Sonny finally has done it!!!! 🙌 Btw why didn&#39;t you let Virginia eat along? lol
did any one catch the magic carpet ride reference? just me? ok thanks bye. haha
"What&#39;s shocking is he didn&#39;t even order anything crazy like whole peking duck, abalone, snow crabs or lobster... Honkong is crazy expensive."
Lmao chicken and eel 42 dollars ripped off
So hong kong isnt china im confused
Anyone knows the name of the 3rd place?
bro got the tourist prices lmao
you dont even need to try to spend 100$ in hk 😂
All those places use the same oil again and again. I wonder what would happen if someone ate that had a shrimp allergy?
Why can she not eat with you?
❤
can the us revert back to this style of resturant/ eatery lol
"Why people in Hong Kong live so long, their high protein diet"
dont make a video with her again please
why do we have no MSG in US?
To be honest years of watching your show and you’re doing the same episode content in so many different countries. I mean come on Sunny can you just spend a $100 it gets old 😂😂<br>Fyi ppl or spoiler alert. 🚨 Sunny spent 100.55$
Chicken organs goes for $11🫢<br><br>That&#39;s not even quality!!!
I see the dynamic with female cohosts/guests has really changed since Japan.
Virginia is a fantastic co-host/guide. I&#39;m sure a lot of people would enjoy seeing her on here more often!
🙆HUMM...<br>WHY DO YOU SEEM TO LOOK <br>HUNGOVER??😉
Stop watching the COMMUNIST CHINAS SOCIAL MEDIA!!!
"I just absolutely love this channel! Sonny not only are you a fantastically entertaining and educational host ,your co- hosts are so likable and fun!  I end up following most of them as well!"
